# Hi, I’m Amy!

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast and recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for defensive security, SOC operations, and hands-on lab environments. I enjoy exploring how attacks work in controlled environments and developing the defenses needed to detect and stop them. My goal is to develop strong blue-team skills and help protect systems, users, and organizations.
